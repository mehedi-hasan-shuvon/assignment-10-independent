                            <p><span className='fw-bold'>Authorization: </span> Authorization is a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file</p>
                            <p><span className='fw-bold'>Authentication: </span> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an individual.</p>
                            <p>There is clear difference between authorization and authentication which are shown below:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Authentication verifies who the user is.However, Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.On the other hand, Authorization always takes place after authentication.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.But, Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <Accordion.Header>Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</Accordion.Header>
                        <Accordion.Body>
                            <p> Firebase is a real-time database that enables me to build sophisticated, collaborative apps by allowing secure access to the database from client-side code.Moreover,Firebase Authentication promises to make creating secure authentication systems simple while also enhancing end-user sign-in and onboarding. It provides an end-to-end identity solution that includes, among other things, email and password accounts, phone authentication, and login to Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub.</p>
                            <p>But there are other option for implementing Authentication system besides firebase.Some of them are given below:</p>
